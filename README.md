# exploratory-data-analysis-of-titanic-dataset
My First Project on Exploratory Data Analysis. Here, I have explored the Titanic dataset present in the Kaggle and tried to analysis it with the help of numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn libraries. In the end, I have also built a simple Logistic regression model and got accuracy of nearly 76%. For that, I have used sklearn library.
